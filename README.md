# Index.JS

This is a medium-weight library I created to simplify a singular task I kept
running into at my work. If this library isn't useful to you, I'm not offended.

The goal of this library is to create indexes on collections of JavaScript
objects so that they can be filtered more efficiently.

The reason I say "medium-weight" is because I've added several hepler functions
that go beyond the basic scope of the library in order to simplify tasks I
encounter at my job.
